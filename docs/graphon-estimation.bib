	abstract = {We propose a nonparametric framework for the analysis of networks, based on a natural limit object termed a graphon. We prove consistency of graphon estimation under general conditions, giving rates which include the important practical setting of sparse networks. Our results cover dense and sparse stochastic blockmodels with a growing number of classes, under model misspecification. We use profile likelihood methods, and connect our results to approximation theory, nonparametric function estimation, and the theory of graph limits.},

	abstract = {Directed graphs occur throughout statistical modeling of networks, and exchangeability is a natural assumption when the ordering of vertices does not matter. There is a deep structural theory for exchangeable undirected graphs, which extends to the directed case via measurable objects known as digraphons. Using digraphons, we first show how to construct models for exchangeable directed graphs, including special cases such as tournaments, linear orderings, directed acyclic graphs, and partial orderings. We then show how to construct priors on digraphons via the infinite relational digraphon model (di-IRM), a new Bayesian nonparametric block model for exchangeable directed graphs, and demonstrate inference on synthetic data.},
